# EffiHR: Empowering HR with Data-Driven Insights

Welcome to the AI-Driven Performance Insight Engine repository. This project showcases the implementation of advanced machine learning techniques to revolutionize HR decision-making. By harnessing the power of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms, we have developed a predictive model that accurately classifies employees' performance, enabling data-driven HR decisions.

## Key Features:

- **High Accuracy Classification:** Our model achieves an impressive 94% accuracy in classifying employees' performance, providing reliable insights for better decision-making.

- **Seamless Integration:** We have seamlessly integrated our AI model with a MySQL database, creating a robust data infrastructure that ensures real-time accessibility to performance insights.

- **Voice Assistant Interface:** A voice assistant interface enhances user experience, enabling intuitive interaction with the AI-driven system. This makes accessing performance insights as easy as having a conversation.

- **User-Friendly UI:** The Tkinter-based user interface offers a visually appealing and user-friendly experience, allowing HR professionals to efficiently retrieve essential information.
